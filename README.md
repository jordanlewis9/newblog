It's been a while since my last post. I feel a bit guilty, but the delay has been for good reason. I got a job as a web developer! My first day was two months ago, back in October. And this goes along with having secured a position as a Teaching Assistant at a remote bootcamp back in September. It's kind of funny how it works - I went from searching for a tech job, to having two within a month. That, along with my wife being 8 months pregnant with our second kid, has made the last couple of months extremely busy and stressful.
<br/><br/>
Enough about that, though. I'm sure anybody reading this is curious how I landed the job, having no work experience and being self-taught. The answer?
<br/><br/>
As Professor McGonagall said, "Sheer Dumb Luck".
<br/><br/>
I wish I could tell other new devs currently looking for their first position that I landed 10 interviews from applications and passed one. Or that I was getting non-stop inquiries regarding my applications. I'm a major introvert, except when 1 on 1 or in a very small group. I'm not great at networking and it makes me as uncomfortable as anything can. I would rather put in applications and get responses back.
<br/><br/>
Instead, an employee at the company I work at now reached out to me on LinkedIn. They mentioned this blog. I made this both as a way to put myself out there and to build something of decent size with PHP. I just got lucky that they stumbled upon my profile, read my blog, and thought highly enough of me to recommend me.
<br/><br/>
The stats in the picture above kept track of places I personally applied to from May to the end of September. I could post my stats from 2 years ago, but those are fairly irrelevant. A company got a "No" only when I actually received communication at some point giving me the gentle "Thanks, but no thanks".
<br/><br/>
75% ghosting rate. That actually got better as I started using more unique job boards. But still, for every 4 applications I sent in, I could expect not hearing a thing about 3 of them.
<br/><br/>
It's depressing. It's demoralizing. It's the reality of someone trying to change careers into web development.
<br/><br/>
But I did put myself out there. I actively tried to tweak my LinkedIn here and there to be more attractive. I posted a blog post and made sure to share to the world. Oh hey, you came to my blog to read this post? While you're here, take a look at these functioning projects I've made. I'll place the link conveniently next to the blogs link. I posted rather frequently on Twitter. I did whatever I could to put myself and my capabilities out there...once I saw traditional applications weren't working.
<br/><br/>
If you're breaking into tech, do that. Don't lie on your resume. Don't try to beat the automated resume readers. Try to get yourself in front of real people, and make them look at you. It's uncomfortable as can be, and you will very much feel like an imposter, a bother. But they're not going to look at your resume. It won't make it past the machine. They're not going to look at your portfolio, because it's listed on your resume that didn't make it past the machine.
<br/><br/>
Another piece of advice I have is to not marry your initial "tech stack". My introductory tech stack was MERN. I learned PHP (and Wordpress, to a much lesser extent) when I realized that companies around me weren't really hiring for MERN. I learned MySQL because I saw many more companies utilizing SQL databases than NoSQL.
<br/><br/>
And you know what I'm working with now? WordPress and PHP.
